# SimpleWebServer_Linux

Sometimes we did the comand: python -m SimpleHTTPServer and our real machines didn't connect to our virtual machines. The solution of this is to disable firewall/antivirus.
In this case, I'm doing a simple webserver, to connect any port (ex: 3000).

commad: python3 Simple_webserver.py
